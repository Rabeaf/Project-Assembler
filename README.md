# Project-Assembler
This project aims to imitates one of every computer most common programs, which is an Assembler. This project was built as a final project for the academic course #20465 - Laboratory in Systems Programming in the open university. The Assembler (written in ANSI C90) is made for a special assembly language defined for the project. The assembler's role is to create a file of machine language from a file written in the assembly language as the first step in a program cycle towards getting the code to run on a computer. The next stages which are the linkage and loading are not part of this program.
